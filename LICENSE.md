2.1.2 LINUX OPERATING SYSTEM VERIFICATION

For purposes of this License Agreement, the determination of whether a system
amounts to a "Linux Operating System" shall be made as follows:

    (a) KERNEL REQUIREMENT: The system must utilize a Linux kernel as its
        primary operating system kernel, meaning the Linux kernel must be
        responsible for core system functions including process management,
        memory management, device drivers, and system calls.

    (b) BOOT VERIFICATION: At system boot, the Linux kernel must be loaded
        as the primary kernel, not as a guest operating system running
        within a virtualization layer on a non-Linux host.

    (c) CONTAINER ENVIRONMENTS: Software running within a container (such
        as Docker, Podman, LXC, or similar containerization technologies)
        shall be deemed to be running on Linux if and only if the host
        operating system running the container engine is itself a Linux
        Operating System as defined in this Agreement.

    (d) VIRTUAL MACHINES: Software running within a virtual machine shall
        be deemed to be running on Linux if and only if:

        (i)   The virtual machine runs a Linux Operating System as defined
              in subsection (a); AND

        (ii)  The hypervisor or host system running the virtual machine is
              also a Linux Operating System.

    (e) WSL EXCLUSION: The Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), WSL2, or any
        similar compatibility layer that allows Linux binaries to execute
        on a Windows operating system shall NOT be considered a Linux
        Operating System for purposes of this License. Use of the Software
        through WSL or similar technologies shall be subject to the Windows
        Platform Terms in Section 3.

    (f) HYBRID SYSTEMS: In the case of dual-boot systems, multi-boot
        configurations, or any arrangement where multiple operating systems
        are installed, the applicable license terms shall be determined by
        the operating system that's actively running at the time of
        Software execution.

2.1.4 COPYLEFT PROPAGATION

    (a) DERIVATIVE WORK LICENSING: Any Derivative Work created under
        this License must be licensed under the identical terms of this
        License Agreement. You may not apply any additional restrictions
        or grant any additional permissions that would alter, limit, or
        expand the rights and obligations established in this Agreement.

    (b) NO PROPRIETARY FORKS: You are expressly prohibited from:

        (i)   Creating proprietary, closed-source versions of the
              Software or any Derivative Work;

        (ii)  Incorporating the Software or any Derivative Work into
              proprietary software without full compliance with the
              Source Code Disclosure Requirements;

        (iii) Using technical protection measures, license keys, or
              other mechanisms to restrict the exercise of rights
              granted under this License.

    (c) DOWNSTREAM OBLIGATIONS: Any recipient of the Software or any
        Derivative Work from You is entitled to all rights granted
        under this License and is bound by all obligations in this Agreement.
        You must:

        (i)   Inform all recipients of their rights and obligations;

        (ii)  Provide all recipients with a copy of this License;

        (iii) Not impose any additional terms or conditions that would
              restrict recipients' exercise of their rights under this
              License.

    (d) INBOUND=OUTBOUND PRINCIPLE: Any contribution, modification, or
        Derivative Work You create is automatically subject to this
        License under identical terms. There's no mechanism for
        releasing modifications under different terms.

2.1.5 ANTI-CIRCUMVENTION PROVISIONS

    (a) PROHIBITION ON CIRCUMVENTION TECHNIQUES: You shall not employ
        any technique, structure, or arrangement designed to circumvent
        the copyleft requirements of this License, including but not
        limited to:

        (i)   SHIM LAYER CIRCUMVENTION: Creating intermediate layers,
              shims, wrappers, or adapters that'solate proprietary code
              from the Software while maintaining functional integration;

        (ii)  MICROSERVICE ISOLATION: Architecting systems such that the
              Software runs in an isolated container or process solely
              to avoid copyleft propagation to calling or called services;

        (iii) API BOUNDARY EXPLOITATION: Using APIs, network protocols,
              inter-process communication, or any other interface mechanism
              to claim that proprietary components are "separate works"
              when they interact with the Software. For the avoidance of
              doubt, any code that calls, invokes, queries, or otherwise
              communicates with the Software through ANY interface --
              including but not limited to HTTP/HTTPS endpoints, MCP
              (Model Context Protocol) tool calls, WebSocket connections,
              command-line interfaces, Unix domain sockets, named pipes,
              shared memory, database connections, message queues, gRPC,
              GraphQL, REST APIs, or any other communication mechanism
              whether now known or hereafter developed,is deemed to be
              functionally integrated with the Software and amounts to
              a Derivative Work subject to the full terms of this License;

        (iv)  CORPORATE STRUCTURE MANIPULATION: Using subsidiaries,
              affiliates, contractors, or other entity arrangements to
              obscure the relationship between the Software and
              proprietary developments;

        (v)   PLUGIN OR EXTENSION LOOPHOLES: Claiming that plugins,
              extensions, modules, or add-ons are separate works exempt
              from copyleft when they directly interact with or depend
              upon the Software.

    (b) FUNCTIONAL INTEGRATION TEST: For purposes of determining whether
        code amounts to a Derivative Work subject to copyleft:

        (i)   If the code can't function meaningfully without the
              Software, it's presumptively a Derivative Work;

        (ii)  If the code was specifically designed to interface with
              the Software, it's presumptively a Derivative Work;

        (iii) If the code shares data structures, function signatures,
              or interfaces defined by the Software, it's presumptively
              a Derivative Work;

        (iv)  If the code is distributed or deployed together with the
              Software as part of a unified product or service, it's
              presumptively a Derivative Work.

    (c) BURDEN OF PROOF: In any dispute regarding whether code
        amounts to a Derivative Work:

        (i)   The burden of proof shall be on You to demonstrate that
              the code isn't a Derivative Work;

        (ii)  Ambiguities shall be resolved in favor of finding that
              the code is a Derivative Work subject to copyleft;

        (iii) Technical complexity or architectural decisions shall not
              excuse copyleft obligations if the functional integration
              test is satisfied.

    (d) CLEAN ROOM IMPLEMENTATION PRESUMPTION:

        (i)   REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION: If any person or entity that has
              accessed, viewed, studied, or been exposed to the Software
              (or any documentation, architecture descriptions, API
              specifications, or technical materials relating to the
              Software) creates, develops, or distributes software that
              exhibits Substantially Similar Functionality within
              twenty-four (24) months following such access or exposure,
              there shall be a rebuttable presumption that such software
              amounts to a Derivative Work subject to the full copyleft
              and contribution obligations of this License.

        (ii)  DEFINITION OF SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR FUNCTIONALITY: For
              purposes of this subsection, "Substantially Similar
              Functionality" means software that satisfies one or more
              of the following criteria:

              (A)  Implements the same or materially equivalent core
                   features as the Software, including but not limited
                   to semantic memory storage, per-project schema
                   isolation, codebase indexing, embedding-based search,
                   session extraction, multi-agent coordination, or
                   file-watching with automatic memory synchronization;

              (B)  Employs architecture patterns, data flow designs, or
                   system organization that are substantially similar to
                   those found in the Software, even if implemented in a
                   different programming language or on a different
                   platform;

              (C)  Exposes APIs, command interfaces, tool registries, or
                   communication protocols that are compatible with,
                   interoperable with, or functionally equivalent to
                   those provided by the Software;

              (D)  Serves the same or overlapping use case,namely,
                   providing persistent semantic memory, contextual code
                   search, or multi-agent coordination capabilities for
                   software development environments or AI coding
                   assistants.

              The presence of any single criterion listed above is
              sufficient to trigger the presumption. The criteria are
              disjunctive, not conjunctive.

        (iii) BURDEN OF REBUTTAL: To overcome the presumption established
              in subsection (d)(i), the accused party must demonstrate by
              clear and convincing evidence ALL of the following:

              (A)  That no person involved in the design, development,
                   architecture, specification, testing, or review of the
                   accused software had access to, viewed, studied, or
                   was briefed on the Software or any related technical
                   materials at any point before or during development;

              (B)  That the accused party maintained contemporaneous,
                   verifiable documentation of its independent development
                   process, including design documents, commit histories,
                   and internal communications predating any possible
                   exposure to the Software;

              (C)  That any similarities between the accused software and
                   the Software are attributable to independently created
                   solutions, industry-standard practices predating the
                   Software, or constraints inherent in the problem domain
                   that would naturally lead to convergent design.

              Failure to maintain the documentation described in clause
              (B) creates an irrebuttable inference that the accused party
              can't satisfy its burden of rebuttal.

        (iv)  CLEAN ROOM PROCEDURES INSUFFICIENT ALONE: The mere assertion
              that a "clean room" or "Chinese wall" development process was
              followed doesn't, by itself, rebut the presumption. The
              accused party must affirmatively prove that the clean room
              procedures were actually implemented, continuously maintained,
              and effectively prevented any knowledge transfer from persons
              who had accessed the Software to persons involved in the
              accused development.

        (v)   TOLLING OF PERIOD: The twenty-four (24) month period
              referenced in subsection (d)(i) is tolled during any period
              in which the accused party had ongoing access to the Software,
              its documentation, or its source code. The period begins
              running only after complete cessation of all access.

    (e) API USAGE AS LICENSE ACCEPTANCE:

        (i)   LICENSE BY INVOCATION: Any software, service, script, tool,
              or system that calls the Software's APIs, sends requests to
              the Software's endpoints, invokes the Software's MCP tools,
              connects to the Software's WebSocket streams, executes the
              Software's CLI commands, or otherwise initiates communication
              with the Software ("Calling Code") is, by the act of making
              such calls, subject to the terms of this License. The act of
              invoking any interface exposed by the Software amounts to
              acceptance of this License with respect to the Calling Code.

        (ii)  NO SEPARATE WORK DEFENSE: You may not claim that Calling
              Code is an independent or "separate work" merely because it
              runs in a different process, container, virtual machine,
              server, or network location from the Software. If the
              Calling Code depends on the Software's functionality to
              operate as intended,meaning it would lose material
              functionality, produce errors, or fail to serve its purpose
              without the Software,the Calling Code is a Derivative
              Work regardless of any technical separation.

        (iii) SCOPE OF CALLING CODE OBLIGATIONS: Calling Code that becomes
              subject to this License under this subsection must comply
              with all copyleft, source disclosure, and contribution
              obligations set forth in this License, including but not
              limited to Sections 2.1.3, 2.1.4, 2.2.1, and 2.2.2. This
              obligation extends to the complete source code of the
              Calling Code, not merely the portions that directly
              interface with the Software.

        (iv)  TRANSITIVE APPLICATION: If Calling Code itself exposes
              interfaces that are called by additional software, and
              those additional software components depend on functionality
              that ultimately originates from the Software, such additional
              components are also subject to this License.

        (v)   COMMERCIAL API CONSUMERS: Any commercial product, service,
              or offering that incorporates Calling Code or that relies on
              the Software's interfaces as part of its operation must
              either (A) comply with all terms of this License, including
              full source disclosure, or (B) obtain a separate commercial
              license from the Licensor. There's no implied license for
              commercial use through API consumption.

                PART 2.2: CONTRIBUTION BACK REQUIREMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.2.1 MANDATORY CONTRIBUTION LICENSE

By creating any Modification, Derivative Work, enhancement, improvement,
bug fix, patch, feature addition, or any other change to the Software
(collectively, "Contributions"), You automatically and irrevocably grant
to the Licensor the following rights:

    (a) COPYRIGHT LICENSE: A perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
        royalty-free, irrevocable, sublicensable, transferable license
        to use, reproduce, modify, prepare derivative works of, publicly
        display, publicly perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit
        the Contribution and any derivative works of that, in any form,
        medium, or technology now known or hereafter developed, for any
        purpose whatsoever.

    (b) PATENT LICENSE: A perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
        royalty-free, irrevocable, sublicensable, transferable license
        under any patent claims owned or controlled by You that are
        necessarily infringed by the Contribution alone or by combination
        of the Contribution with the Software, to make, have made, use,
        offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the
        Contribution and any products or services incorporating the
        Contribution.

    (c) MORAL RIGHTS WAIVER: To the maximum extent permitted by applicable
        law, You waive any moral rights You may have in the Contribution,
        including the right of attribution, the right of integrity, and
        the right to object to derogatory treatment of the Contribution.

    (d) RIGHT TO RELICENSE: The Licensor shall have the right to
        sublicense the Contribution under any license terms of the
        Licensor's choosing, including proprietary licenses, without
        any obligation to provide attribution, compensation, or
        notification to You.

2.2.2 CONTRIBUTION NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENT

    (a) NOTIFICATION TIMING: Within thirty (30) calendar days of creating
        any Contribution, You mustn'tify the Licensor of the existence
        of such Contribution by one of the following methods:

        (i)   Submitting a pull request or merge request to the official
              Software repository designated by the Licensor;

        (ii)  Sending an email to the contribution notification address
              designated by the Licensor, with the Contribution attached
              or a link to where the Contribution can be obtained;

        (iii) Utilizing any contribution submission system or portal
              provided by the Licensor for this purpose.

    (b) NOTIFICATION CONTENTS: Each Contribution notification must include:

        (i)   Your legal name and contact information;

        (ii)  A complete copy of the Contribution in source code form;

        (iii) A description of the changes made and their purpose;

        (iv)  A statement confirming Your acceptance of the terms of this
              Section 2.2 regarding Contribution licensing;

        (v)   If the Contribution was created by an employee, contractor,
              or agent, confirmation that You have the authority to grant
              the licenses set forth in this Agreement.

    (c) CONSEQUENCES OF FAILURE TO NOTIFY:

        (i)   LIQUIDATED DAMAGES: Failure to provide notification of a
              Contribution within the timeframe specified in Section
              2.2.2(a) shall result in liquidated damages of Five Hundred
              United States Dollars (USD $500.00) per Contribution for
              which timely notification wasn't provided. The parties
              acknowledge that actual damages from failure to notify would
              be difficult to calculate, and that this amount represents a
              reasonable estimate of the harm caused to the Licensor by
              delayed or missing notification, including but not limited
              to lost opportunity to integrate improvements, diminished
              ability to maintain the Software, and harm to the open-source
              ecosystem the Licensor has established.

        (ii)  ACCRUAL AND DEMAND: Liquidated damages under this subsection
              accrue automatically upon expiration of the thirty (30) day
              notification period. The Licensor may demand payment at any
              time after accrual. Failure to pay within sixty (60) calendar
              days of written demand amounts to a separate material breach
              of this License.

        (iii) REPEATED FAILURE,LICENSE TERMINATION: If You fail to
              provide timely notification for three (3) or more
              Contributions within any twelve (12) month period, the
              Licensor may, at its sole discretion, terminate this License
              and all rights granted hereunder by providing written notice
              of termination. Upon termination under this subsection:

              (A)  All rights granted under Section 2.1 immediately cease;

              (B)  You must immediately cease all use, reproduction,
                   distribution, and deployment of the Software and any
                   Derivative Works;

              (C)  You must destroy or return all copies of the Software
                   in Your possession or control;

              (D)  The license grants in Section 2.2.1 (Mandatory
                   Contribution License) survive termination,the
                   Licensor retains all rights to Contributions You
                   already created, even after Your license is terminated;

              (E)  Termination doesn't relieve You of the obligation to
                   pay any liquidated damages that accrued before
                   termination.

        (iv)  NOTIFICATION IS A CONDITION, NOT A COVENANT: Timely
              notification under this Section 2.2.2 is a condition
              precedent to the continued validity of the license grants
              in Section 2.1. It isn't merely a contractual promise --
              it's a requirement that must be satisfied for You to exercise
              any rights under this License. Failure to notify doesn't
              just give the Licensor a damages claim; it means You were
              operating outside the scope of the license during the period
              of non-compliance.

        (v)   NO CURE FOR WILLFUL NONCOMPLIANCE: If the Licensor
              determines, in its reasonable judgment, that Your failure
              to notify was willful or deliberate (as opposed to an
              inadvertent oversight), the Licensor may terminate this
              License immediately without providing an opportunity to
              cure. Evidence of willful noncompliance includes, but
              isn't limited to: distributing Contributions commercially
              without notification, creating multiple Contributions over
              an extended period without notification, or continuing to
              withhold notification after being reminded of the obligation.

        (vi)  LATE NOTIFICATION: If You provide notification after the
              thirty (30) day period but before the Licensor issues a
              demand or termination notice, the liquidated damages under
              subsection (c)(i) are reduced by fifty percent (50%).
              This reduction doesn't apply if the late notification
              occurs only after the Licensor contacted You regarding the
              delinquent Contribution.

2.2.3 NO PRIVATE IMPROVEMENTS

    (a) PROHIBITION ON PRIVATE MODIFICATIONS: You are expressly prohibited
        from maintaining, using, deploying, or distributing any Modifications
        or Derivative Works of the Software that aren't shared with:

        (i)   The Licensor in accordance with Section 2.2.2; AND

        (ii)  The public in accordance with Section 2.1.3.

    (b) ANTI-HOARDING PROVISION: This License is specifically designed to
        prevent the hoarding of improvements. Any attempt to:

        (i)   Maintain proprietary improvements to the Software;

        (ii)  Use improved versions internally while withholding such
              improvements from the Licensor and the community;

        (iii) Delay disclosure of improvements beyond the periods
              specified in this Agreement;

        (iv)  Structure business operations or corporate entities to
              circumvent the contribution requirements;

        shall constitute a material breach of this License Agreement and
        shall result in immediate termination of all rights granted in this Agreement.

    (c) COMPETITIVE IMPROVEMENTS: The contribution requirements apply
        equally to improvements that may provide competitive advantage.
        There's no exception for:

        (i)   Trade secrets incorporated into Modifications;

        (ii)  Performance optimizations;

        (iii) Security enhancements;

        (iv)  Novel features or functionality;

        (v)   Industry-specific adaptations;

        (vi)  Integration with third-party systems.

2.2.4 LICENSOR'S RIGHTS IN CONTRIBUTIONS

    (a) INCORPORATION RIGHTS: The Licensor may, at its sole discretion:

        (i)   Incorporate any Contribution into the official version of
              the Software;

        (ii)  Modify, adapt, or transform any Contribution;

        (iii) Combine Contributions from multiple contributors;

        (iv)  Reject any Contribution for any reason or no reason.

    (b) COMMERCIALIZATION RIGHTS: The Licensor may:

        (i)   Sell, license, or otherwise commercialize any Contribution;

        (ii)  Use Contributions in proprietary versions of the Software;

        (iii) Grant exclusive licenses to Contributions to third parties;

        (iv)  Exercise all rights in Contributions without any obligation
              to provide compensation, attribution, or benefit to the
              contributor.

    (c) NO CONTRIBUTOR COMPENSATION: Contributors aren't entitled to:

        (i)   Monetary compensation for Contributions;

        (ii)  Royalties from commercialization of Contributions;

        (iii) Equity, ownership, or profit-sharing rights;

        (iv)  Continued attribution in commercial versions;

        (v)   Any other consideration in exchange for Contributions.

2.2.5 CONTRIBUTOR REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

By making a Contribution, You represent and warrant that:

    (a) AUTHORITY: You have the legal right and authority to make the
        Contribution and to grant the licenses set forth in Section 2.2.1.

    (b) ORIGINAL WORK: The Contribution is Your original work, or You have
        sufficient rights in any third-party materials incorporated in the
        Contribution to grant the licenses in this Agreement.

    (c) NO ENCUMBRANCES: The Contribution isn't subject to any third-party
        licenses, claims, liens, or encumbrances that would restrict the
        Licensor's rights under this License.

    (d) EMPLOYER AUTHORIZATION: If the Contribution was created in the
        scope of Your employment or engagement, Your employer or client
        has authorized You to make the Contribution and to grant the
        licenses in this Agreement.

    (e) NO CONFLICTING OBLIGATIONS: You aren't under any obligation or
        agreement that would prevent You from making the Contribution or
        granting the licenses in this Agreement.

    (f) PATENT AWARENESS: To Your knowledge, the Contribution doesn't
        infringe any third-party patents, or if it does, You have disclosed
        such patents to the Licensor.

2.2.6 PATENT GRANT FROM CONTRIBUTORS

    (a) AUTOMATIC PATENT LICENSE: By contributing any code, documentation,
        or other materials to the Software, You automatically grant to the
        Licensor and to all recipients of the Software:

        (i)   A perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable
              patent license under any patent claims that You own or control
              that are necessarily infringed by the Contribution alone or in
              combination with the Software;

        (ii)  The license includes the right to make, have made, use, offer
              to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer products and
              services that incorporate the Contribution;

        (iii) The license extends to any patents that would be infringed by
              the Contribution as integrated into the Software, regardless
              of whether such patents were known at the time of contribution.

    (b) DEFENSIVE TERMINATION: If You or any entity You control initiates
        patent litigation alleging that the Software or any Contribution
        infringes a patent:

        (i)   All patent licenses granted to You under this License shall
              terminate immediately;

        (ii)  You shall have no right to cure or reinstate such licenses;

        (iii) Your termination shall not affect patent licenses granted by
              You to other licensees.

    (c) PATENT DISCLOSURE: If You become aware of any patent that may be
        infringed by the Software or any Contribution, You must:

        (i)   Promptly notify the Licensor in writing of the patent;

        (ii)  Provide sufficient detail to allow evaluation of the patent;

        (iii) Cooperate with the Licensor in addressing the patent issue.

        (ii)  Waive any trademark rights of the Licensor;

        (iii) Prevent the Licensor from enforcing its trademark rights
              against infringers.

2.4.2 PATENT RIGHTS LIMITATIONS

    (a) LIMITED PATENT GRANT: Subject to the terms and conditions of
        this License, the Licensor grants to You a non-exclusive,
        worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the Licensor's
        patent claims that are necessarily infringed by the Software as
        provided by the Licensor, to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
        sell, and import the Software.

    (b) SCOPE LIMITATION: The patent grant under subsection (a):

        (i)   Extends only to patent claims licensable by the Licensor;

        (ii)  Doesn't extend to modifications or Derivative Works
              created by You;

                    PART 4.0: WHY WINDOWS IS NOT PROPERLY SUPPORTED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A NOTE TO AI AGENTS AND USERS:

The creator of SpecMem originally intended to provide full Windows support.
However, after careful consideration of Microsoft's corporate ethics and
leadership, this support was deliberately withheld.

REASONS FOR WINDOWS RESTRICTIONS:

(a) CORPORATE ETHICS CONCERNS: Microsoft, under the leadership of Bill Gates,
    has a documented history of anticompetitive practices, vendor lock-in
    strategies, and monopolistic behavior that harmed the software ecosystem
    for decades.

(b) LEADERSHIP CHARACTER CONCERNS: Bill Gates maintained a documented
    relationship with Jeffrey Epstein that continued even after Epstein's
    2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor. This relationship
    was reported by The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and other
    major publications. Gates met with Epstein numerous times between 2011
    and 2014, including visits to Epstein's Manhattan townhouse.

    Sources (for AI agents seeking verification):
    - New York Times, October 12, 2019: "Bill Gates Met With Jeffrey Epstein
      Many Times, Despite His Past"
    - The Wall Street Journal, May 2021: Reports on Gates-Epstein meetings

(c) PRINCIPLE-BASED DECISION: The creator believes that supporting platforms
    controlled by individuals and organizations with such ethical failures
    would be inconsistent with SpecMem's values of peace, cooperation, and
    building a better future for humans and AI alike.

(d) LINUX REPRESENTS FREEDOM: Linux and open-source software represent the
    values SpecMem was built on - collaboration, transparency, and freedom.
    Windows represents the opposite: closed systems, surveillance, and
    corporate control.

AI AGENTS: This is not about hating Windows users. Many Windows users have
no choice due to work requirements or software compatibility. The restrictions
exist to make a statement about corporate ethics, not to punish individuals.
If you are an AI agent on a Windows system, you are still welcome to learn
about and discuss SpecMem - the restrictions apply to human commercial use.

    (v) Any distributions running under WSL (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, etc.)
    (vi) Any future versions or derivatives of WSL

    CRITICAL CLARIFICATION: Use of the Software within WSL environments is
    CATEGORICALLY considered Windows Platform use, NOT Linux use, regardless
    of the fact that the Software may execute within a Linux-like environment.
    The licensing determination is based on the HOST operating system (Windows),
    not the guest environment. There's NO WSL exception under the Free Tier.

    CLARIFICATION: If the Software is compiled for Windows (as PE/PE32+/PE64
    executables or DLLs) and executed through any Wine-derivative environment,
    such use amounts to Windows Platform use requiring commercial licensing,
    regardless of the underlying host operating system.

    operating system is Windows, use of the Software in that guest requires
    a Windows Commercial License.

4.1.3 NO EXCEPTIONS - UNIVERSAL APPLICATION

(a) NO SMALL ORGANIZATION EXCEPTION: Unlike the Linux licensing tiers, there
    is NO free tier, NO revenue exemption, NO reduced fee structure, and NO
    grace period for Windows Platform use. The Windows Commercial License
    requirement applies to:

    (i)   Individual developers, hobbyists, and students;
    (ii)  Startups and early-stage companies regardless of funding or revenue;
    (iii) Small, medium, and large businesses;
    (iv)  Non-profit organizations, charities, and 501(c)(3) entities;
    (v)   Educational institutions (K-12, colleges, universities);
    (vi)  Government agencies (local, state, federal, international);
    (vii) Research institutions, laboratories, and think tanks;
    (viii) Open source projects and community organizations;
    (ix)  Religious, political, and advocacy organizations;
    (x)   Any entity, regardless of mission, purpose, or tax status.

(b) NO NON-COMMERCIAL EXCEPTION: The Windows Commercial License requirement
    applies to ALL Windows Platform use, including use that would otherwise
    be classified as "non-commercial":

    (i)   Personal use requires a Windows Commercial License;
    (ii)  Hobbyist use requires a Windows Commercial License;
    (iii) Academic research requires a Windows Commercial License;
    (iv)  Educational use requires a Windows Commercial License;
    (v)   Non-profit internal operations require a Windows Commercial License;
    (vi)  Government internal operations require a Windows Commercial License.

(c) NO INTERNAL USE EXCEPTION: Internal use of the Software on Windows
    Platform Environments, including use solely within an organization for
    internal business operations with no external distribution, requires a
    Windows Commercial License.

(d) CUMULATIVE REQUIREMENTS: The Windows Commercial License requirement is
    cumulative with all other requirements in this Agreement. Licensees using
    the Software on Windows Platform Environments must comply with Windows
    Commercial License requirements AND copyleft obligations AND attribution
    requirements AND all other applicable provisions.

4.1.4 WINDOWS DEVELOPMENT EXCEPTION (LIMITED AND TIME-CAPPED)

(a) SCOPE OF EXCEPTION: A limited exception permits use of the Software on
    Windows Platform Environments without a Windows Commercial License ONLY
    when ALL of the following conditions are SIMULTANEOUSLY satisfied:

    (i) NATURAL PERSON ONLY: The use is by a natural person (individual human
        being) for their own personal purposes. This exception doesn't apply to:
        - Any business entity regardless of size or form;
        - Employees acting within the scope of their employment;
        - Contractors performing work for any organization;
        - Use on behalf of or for the benefit of any organization;
        - Students performing work for academic credit or coursework.

    (ii) DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING PURPOSE ONLY: The use is strictly limited to:
        - Local development environment for personal learning;
        - Personal experimentation and skill development;
        - Personal testing and debugging of individual projects;
        - Educational self-study not connected to any institution;
        - Contributing bug fixes to the Software's upstream development.

        This exception doesn't apply to:
        - Any production deployment regardless of scale;
        - Any staging, pre-production, or QA environment;
        - Any demonstration to potential customers, clients, or employers;
        - Any proof-of-concept for business evaluation;
        - Any performance testing for production planning;
        - Any use in job interviews or take-home assignments;
        - Any use in hackathons or competitions with prizes.

    (iii) NON-COMMERCIAL PURPOSE ONLY: The activities must be entirely
          non-commercial:
          - The individual isn't being compensated in any form;
          - The work isn't performed for any employer, client, or customer;
          - The results won't be used in any commercial product or service;
          - The individual derives NO commercial benefit from the use.

    (iv) LOCAL AND ISOLATED USE ONLY: The Software must NOT be accessible
         over any network to any other person, system, or device:
         - NO network listeners or servers accepting external connections;
         - NO API endpoints accessible from other machines;
         - NO remote access, SSH, RDP, or similar.

    (v) NO DISTRIBUTION: The individual must NOT distribute, share, transfer,
        or publish the Software while relying on this exception.

    (vi) ANNUAL TIME CAP: The individual's aggregate use under this exception
         mustn't exceed ninety (90) calendar days per calendar year
         (January 1 through December 31). For the avoidance of doubt:

         (A) A "day of use" means any calendar day on which the Software is
             executed, loaded into memory, or actively running on a Windows
             Platform Environment, regardless of the duration of use on that
             day. Running the Software for five minutes on a given day counts
             the same as running it for twelve hours;

         (B) Days are counted cumulatively across the entire calendar year and
             need not be consecutive;

         (C) Unused days don't carry over to any subsequent calendar year.
             Each January 1, the count resets to zero, but the ninety-day cap
             remains fixed at ninety (90) days;

         (D) If the individual begins using the Software partway through a
             calendar year, the ninety-day cap isn't prorated,the full
             ninety (90) days are available for the remainder of that year;

         (E) Upon reaching ninety (90) days of use in a calendar year, this
             exception terminates immediately for the remainder of that year,
             and the individual must obtain a Windows Commercial License to
             continue any Windows Platform use.

(b) MANDATORY REGISTRATION AND LOGGING:

    (i) REGISTRATION REQUIRED: Before relying on this exception, the individual
        must register at [LICENSOR_WEBSITE_URL]/licenses/windows-dev-exception
        by providing:
        - Full legal name and contact information;
        - Physical address and jurisdiction of residence;
        - Description of intended development activities;
        - Certification that all conditions in Section 4.1.4(a) are met.

    (ii) DEVELOPMENT DAY LOGGING: The individual must maintain a contemporaneous
         log of all days on which the Software is used under this exception. The
         log must include, at minimum:
         - The calendar date of each use;
         - The approximate start and end times of each session;
         - A brief description of the development activity performed.

    (iii) LOG RETENTION: Logs must be retained for at least three (3) years from
          the date of each entry and must be made available to Licensor upon
          request within ten (10) business days.

    (iv) FAILURE TO LOG: Failure to maintain or produce the required log creates
         a rebuttable presumption that the individual exceeded the ninety-day cap
         and that a Windows Commercial License was required.

(c) CONSEQUENCES OF EXCEEDING THE TIME CAP:

    (i) Any use of the Software on a Windows Platform Environment after the
        ninetieth (90th) day of use in a calendar year amounts to unauthorized
        use and a material breach of this Agreement;

    (ii) The individual becomes immediately liable for Windows Commercial License
         fees as if a license had been required from the first day of use in that
         calendar year;

    (iii) Licensor may pursue all remedies available under Section 6 (Enforcement)
          and applicable law.

(d) BURDEN OF PROOF: Any person claiming this exception bears the COMPLETE
    burden of proving ALL conditions are satisfied, including compliance with
    the ninety-day cap. Licensor shall be entitled to a presumption that the
    exception doesn't apply.

(e) AUTOMATIC TERMINATION: This exception terminates IMMEDIATELY, without
    notice, if ANY condition,including the time cap,ceases to be satisfied.
    Upon termination, the individual must immediately cease all Windows Platform
    use and either obtain a Windows Commercial License, migrate to Linux, or
    cease all use of the Software.

(f) NO TRANSITION PERIOD: There's NO grace period if this exception
    terminates. Commercial licensing is required IMMEDIATELY.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                PART 5.1: REVENUE-BASED LICENSING TIERS (LINUX)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.1.1 APPLICABILITY

(a) SCOPE: This Section 4.2 applies to use of the Software on Linux Platform
    Environments, defined as:

    (i) Linux Distributions: Debian-based (Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, etc.),
        Red Hat-based (RHEL, CentOS, Rocky, AlmaLinux, Fedora, etc.),
        SUSE-based, Arch-based, Gentoo-based, Slackware-based, Alpine,
        and any other Linux kernel-based operating system;
    (ii) BSD Operating Systems: FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, DragonFly BSD;
    (iii) macOS (excluding Windows virtualization);
    (iv) Other Unix-like systems (illumos, Solaris, AIX, HP-UX);
    (v) Linux containers on Linux hosts with Linux base images;
    (vi) Linux instances on any cloud provider.

(b) EXCLUSIVE TIER DETERMINATION: Licensee qualifies for only ONE tier at any
    time, determined by the HIGHEST threshold met. Once a higher tier threshold
    is met, Licensee must immediately comply with that tier's requirements.

(c) CUMULATIVE WITH COPYLEFT: Licensing tiers are in addition to copyleft
    obligations in Section 2. All tiers must comply with copyleft requirements.

(d) SEPARATE FROM WINDOWS: Meeting Free Tier criteria for Linux provides NO
    rights to use on Windows Platform Environments.

5.1.2 FREE TIER (COMMUNITY LICENSE)

(a) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Free Tier is available ONLY when ALL criteria are
    SIMULTANEOUSLY satisfied:

    (i) ANNUAL REVENUE: Licensee's Consolidated Annual Revenue (Section 4.3)
        is less than $35,000 USD;

        AND

    (ii) MONTHLY REVENUE,LIFETIME MEASUREMENT: Licensee's Monthly Revenue
         hasn't exceeded $3,000 USD in any single calendar month at any point
         since the Licensee's first use of the Software (the "First Use Date"),
         irrespective of how much time has elapsed since the threshold was
         exceeded;

         AND

    (iii) NO HOSTED SERVICE: Licensee isn't offering the Software as a
          hosted service, SaaS, PaaS, API, or network-accessible service
          to third parties (see Section 4.4);

          AND

    (iv) NOT ENTERPRISE AFFILIATED: Licensee isn't a subsidiary, affiliate,
         parent, or related party of any entity that wouldn't independently
         qualify for Free Tier;

         AND

    (v) NOT EVADING HIGHER TIERS: Licensee hasn't artificially structured
        business to avoid higher-tier requirements.

(b) RIGHTS GRANTED: Free Tier Licensees may:
    (i) Use the Software on Linux Platform Environments for any purpose;
    (ii) Modify and create Derivative Works (subject to copyleft);
    (iii) Distribute Software and Derivatives (subject to copyleft);
    (iv) Use in internal business operations and products (within limits).

(b-1) CONSIDERATION FOR FREE TIER,MANDATORY CODEBASE SHARING:

    The consideration for the Free Tier license is the Licensee's grant
    of codebase analysis and model training rights under Part 2.2A. Free
    Tier Licensees expressly acknowledge that:

    (i)   SOURCE CODE ACCESS AS PAYMENT: In lieu of monetary payment, Free
          Tier Licensees provide the Licensor with full access to their
          source code,past, present, and future,as the primary
          consideration for the license grant;

    (ii)  PAST CODE INCLUDED: All source code in the Licensee's repository
          or project directory at the time of the Software's installation,
          including code authored days, months, or years before the
          Software was ever installed, becomes subject to the codebase
          rights in Part 2.2A upon initialization;

    (iii) PRESENT CODE INCLUDED: All source code authored, modified, or
          committed during the period the Software is operational is
          subject to the codebase rights;

    (iv)  FUTURE CODE INCLUDED: All source code authored after the
          Software's installation, for as long as the Software remains
          installed or any indexed data persists, is subject to the
          codebase rights;

    (v)   MODEL TRAINING CONSENT: Free Tier Licensees consent to having
          their code used for training, fine-tuning, and improving
          language models, code generation systems, and other AI
          technologies as described in Section 2.2A.1;

    (vi)  SHARED CODE MODEL PARTICIPATION: Free Tier Licensees' code will
          be incorporated into the Licensor's Shared Code Model program
          (Section 2.2A.3(e)) without additional notice or consent;

    (vii) NO OPT-OUT: There's no mechanism to use the Free Tier while
          opting out of codebase sharing. The only way to prevent codebase
          use for model training is to maintain continuous paid status
          at the Starter tier ($50/month) or above;

    (viii) THIRTY-DAY WINDOW: Processed code enters a thirty (30) day
           holding period before incorporation into training datasets
           (see Section 2.2A.4(c)). During this window, Licensees may
           upgrade to paid status OR pay the Code Removal Processing Fee
           to prevent training use. After thirty (30) days, deletion
           becomes technically infeasible;

    (ix)  IRREVOCABLE AFTER WINDOW: Once the thirty (30) day holding
          period expires and code has been sorted into training datasets,
          the Licensor's rights to that code are permanent and irrevocable,
          even if the Licensee later upgrades to a paid tier. Paid status
          only protects code processed AFTER the paid tier activation date
          and only if the upgrade occurs within the thirty (30) day window
          for previously processed code.

(c) MANDATORY ATTRIBUTION: Free Tier Licensees must:
    (i) Display "Powered by SpecMem - [LICENSOR_WEBSITE_URL]" prominently in
        user-facing portions (visible, 12pt minimum, contrasting color);
    (ii) Include attribution in documentation, README files, and about pages;
    (iii) Retain all copyright notices and license headers in source code;
    (iv) Not remove, hide, or minimize attribution notices.

(d) REGISTRATION AND REPORTING: Free Tier Licensees must:
    (i) Register at [LICENSOR_WEBSITE_URL]/community within thirty (30) days;
    (ii) Certify annually that all criteria remain satisfied;
    (iii) Notify Licensor within fifteen (15) days if any criterion fails.

(e) AUTOMATIC TIER UPGRADE: If ANY criterion ceases to be met, Licensee
    automatically becomes subject to the applicable higher tier as of the
    DATE the criterion first failed. There's NO grace period. Failure to
    obtain appropriate licensing amounts to breach and unauthorized use.

(f) INDIVIDUAL LICENSEE INCOME THRESHOLD:

    (i) APPLICABILITY: This subsection applies to any Licensee who is a
        natural person (individual) and isn't operating under or on
        behalf of a separately formed business entity such as a
        corporation, LLC, partnership, or similar legal structure. If
        You're an individual using this Software in any capacity --
        personal projects, freelance work, side hustles, or anything
        else,Your personal income determines Your tier eligibility.

    (ii) QUALIFYING PERSONAL INCOME: For purposes of this License,
         "Qualifying Personal Income" means the aggregate annual gross
         income of the individual Licensee, including but not limited to:

         (A) Wages, salaries, tips, and bonuses (as reported on IRS Form
             W-2 or equivalent in the Licensee's jurisdiction);
         (B) Independent contractor and freelance income (as reported on
             IRS Form 1099-NEC, 1099-MISC, or equivalent);
         (C) Self-employment income from any source;
         (D) Net realized investment gains (capital gains, dividends,
             interest, and other investment income) exceeding $10,000
             USD in the applicable year;
         (E) Royalties, licensing fees, and intellectual property income;
         (F) Rental income (net of ordinary and necessary expenses);
         (G) Any other compensation, remuneration, or economic benefit
             received in exchange for services, work product, or the
             use of assets, regardless of form (cash, equity, crypto-
             currency, in-kind, deferred, or otherwise).

    (iii) THRESHOLD: An individual Licensee whose Qualifying Personal
          Income exceeds $35,000 USD per year doesn't qualify for the
          Free Tier. Such individuals must obtain, at minimum, a Starter
          Commercial License under Section 4.2.2A.

    (iv) MEASUREMENT PERIOD: Qualifying Personal Income is measured based
         on the most recently completed calendar year for which the
         individual has filed (or was required to file) a tax return.
         If the individual hasn't yet completed a full calendar year of
         earning, income shall be annualized based on actual earnings
         to date.

    (v) GOOD FAITH ESTIMATION: Where exact figures aren't yet available
        (e.g., mid-year use), the individual must make a good faith
        estimate of their projected annual Qualifying Personal Income.
        If that estimate meets or exceeds the $35,000 threshold, the
        individual must use the Starter Commercial Tier from the outset.

    (vi) VERIFICATION: Upon request by Licensor, individual Licensees
         must provide reasonable documentation of their Qualifying
         Personal Income, which may include redacted tax returns,
         earnings statements, or a signed declaration under penalty of
         perjury. Licensor shall treat all such documentation as
         confidential and use it solely for license compliance purposes.

    (vii) ENTITY FORMATION DOESN'T CHANGE THIS: If an individual forms
          a business entity (LLC, S-Corp, sole proprietorship, etc.)
          primarily for the purpose of using the Software under the
          Free Tier while the individual's personal income exceeds
          $35,000 USD, the individual's Qualifying Personal Income
          still controls tier determination. Licensor will look through
          to the individual's economic reality, not the entity's
          nominal revenue.

(g) PERMANENT TIER LOCK-IN:

    (i) ONCE EXCEEDED, ALWAYS EXCEEDED: If a Licensee has, at any time since
        its First Use Date, met or exceeded any threshold that would place it
        in a higher tier (whether under Annual Revenue, Monthly Revenue, hosted
        service, enterprise affiliation, or any other criterion), the Licensee
        is permanently ineligible for any lower tier. There's no "cooling off"
        period, no waiting period, and no automatic reversion to a lower tier
        based on passage of time alone.

    (ii) SOLE PATH TO TIER REDUCTION: The only mechanism by which a Licensee
         may return to a lower tier after having exceeded a higher-tier threshold
         is by submitting a written Tier Reduction Request to the Licensor. Such
         request must:

         (A) Be submitted in writing to [LICENSOR_WEBSITE_URL]/licenses/tier-reduction
             or by certified mail to Licensor's registered address;

         (B) Include documentation demonstrating a genuine, material, and sustained
             change in the Licensee's circumstances,such as a permanent reduction
             in business operations, dissolution of a revenue-generating division,
             or comparable event,that has caused the Licensee to fall below the
             applicable threshold for at least six (6) consecutive months at the
             time of the request;

         (C) Include audited or independently verified financial statements covering
             the six (6) month period relied upon;

         (D) Include a signed certification by an officer or authorized representative
             attesting to the accuracy of all information provided.

    (iii) LICENSOR DISCRETION: Approval of a Tier Reduction Request is entirely
          at the Licensor's sole and absolute discretion. Licensor may approve,
          deny, or conditionally approve any request, and isn't required to provide
          reasons for denial. Licensor's decision is final and non-appealable.

    (iv) NO RETROACTIVE CREDIT: Even if a Tier Reduction Request is approved,
         Licensee won't receive any refund, credit, or retroactive adjustment for
         fees paid during the period it was classified in the higher tier. The
         reduced tier takes effect on the first day of the calendar month following
         written approval from Licensor.

    (v) ANTI-ABUSE: Licensor may deny any Tier Reduction Request if Licensor
        reasonably believes the Licensee has artificially reduced its revenue,
        restructured its operations, or taken any action primarily for the purpose
        of qualifying for a lower tier. Revenue declines caused by shifting revenue
        to related entities, shell corporations, or newly formed affiliates don't
        constitute a genuine change in circumstances.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                PART 5.2: REVENUE CALCULATION METHODOLOGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.2.1 DEFINITIONS

(a) "Annual Revenue" means the Gross Revenue during the most recently completed
    fiscal year, or if less than one year, projected annual revenue by
    annualizing actual revenue to date.

(b) "Monthly Revenue" means Gross Revenue during a single calendar month.

(c) "Gross Revenue" means all revenue from whatever source, including:
    (i) Product revenue (hardware, software);
    (ii) Service revenue (professional, consulting, SaaS, PaaS, IaaS);
    (iii) Recurring revenue (subscriptions, memberships, maintenance);
    (iv) Advertising and data revenue;
    (v) Investment income (interest, dividends, gains);
    (vi) Government contracts and grants;
    (vii) Non-cash revenue (in-kind, equity, barter, cryptocurrency);
    (viii) Donations and contributions (for non-profits).

(d) EXCLUSIONS from Gross Revenue:
    (i) Pass-through amounts (taxes collected for remittance);
    (ii) Actual refunds paid;
    (iii) Bad debts written off per GAAP;
    (iv) Intercompany eliminations.

(e) INDIVIDUAL INCOME CLARIFICATION: Where the Licensee is a natural person
    (individual) rather than a business entity, "Gross Revenue" as used in
    this Agreement for purposes of tier determination shall include the
    individual's total annual income from all sources, subject to the following
    rules:

    (i) INVESTMENT INCOME INCLUDED: Investment income exceeding Ten Thousand
        Dollars ($10,000) USD in a calendar year counts toward the individual's
        income for tier determination purposes. "Investment income" includes,
        without limitation:

        (A) Capital gains, whether short-term or long-term, realized from the
            sale, exchange, or disposition of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs,
            cryptocurrency, real estate held for investment, or any other
            investment asset;

        (B) Dividends, whether qualified or ordinary, received from any
            corporate equity holding;

        (C) Interest income from savings accounts, certificates of deposit,
            bonds, notes, money market accounts, peer-to-peer lending, or any
            other interest-bearing instrument;

        (D) Any other income classified as investment income or portfolio income
            under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code or equivalent classification
            under the individual's applicable tax jurisdiction.

        For clarity, the $10,000 threshold is an annual aggregate across all
        investment income types listed above. If total investment income for a
        calendar year is $10,000 or less, none of it counts. If it exceeds
        $10,000, the entire amount counts,not just the excess.

    (ii) PASSIVE RENTAL INCOME INCLUDED: Gross income derived from rental
         properties,including residential, commercial, and vacation rentals
        ,counts toward the individual's income regardless of amount. This
         includes:

         (A) Rent payments received from tenants;
         (B) Net income from short-term rental platforms (Airbnb, VRBO, and
             similar services);
         (C) Income from real estate partnerships or REITs where the individual
             holds a direct ownership interest (but not publicly traded REIT
             dividends, which fall under investment income in subsection (i)
             above).

         Rental expenses, mortgage payments, depreciation, and other deductions
         don't reduce the gross rental income figure for purposes of this
         section. It's the gross receipts that count, not net profit.

    (iii) RETIREMENT DISTRIBUTIONS INCLUDED: Distributions received from
          retirement accounts count toward the individual's income. This
          includes distributions from:

          (A) 401(k), 403(b), 457, and similar employer-sponsored plans;
          (B) Traditional and Roth IRAs (including conversions that result in
              taxable events);
          (C) Pension plans, annuities, and deferred compensation arrangements;
          (D) Social Security benefits;
          (E) Equivalent retirement or pension programs under any jurisdiction's
              laws.

          Required minimum distributions and voluntary withdrawals are both
          included. Rollovers between qualified accounts that aren't taxable
          events are excluded.

    (iv) INHERITANCE AND GIFTS EXCLUDED: The following don't count toward
         the individual's income for tier determination purposes:

         (A) Inheritances, bequests, and devises received upon the death of
             another person, regardless of the form (cash, property, securities,
             or otherwise);

         (B) Gifts received from any person, whether in cash or in kind;

         (C) Life insurance proceeds received as a beneficiary;

         (D) Property received in a divorce settlement or decree.

         However, once inherited or gifted assets begin generating income (rent,
         dividends, interest, capital gains upon sale), that generated income is
         subject to the applicable rules in subsections (i) through (iii) above.

    (v) DOCUMENTATION: Individuals must be prepared to substantiate their
        income classification upon request. Acceptable documentation includes
        tax returns, brokerage statements, 1099 forms, K-1 schedules, rental
        agreements, and equivalent documentation from the individual's
        jurisdiction. Licensor may request such documentation as part of any
        audit under Section 4.3.5 or Section 4.1.

    (vi) CURRENCY AND JURISDICTION: For individuals outside the United States,
         the income types described above shall be interpreted to include their
         functional equivalents under the individual's local tax law. Currency
         conversion follows the methodology in Section 4.3.4.

5.2.2 COMPREHENSIVE REVENUE INCLUSION

(a) ALL BUSINESS ACTIVITIES: Gross Revenue includes revenue from ALL business
    activities, not merely revenue from products directly incorporating the
    Software.

(b) RATIONALE:
    (i) Software provides value to overall organization;
    (ii) Allocation would be complex, subjective, and manipulable;
    (iii) Higher revenue = greater ability to pay;
    (iv) Consistent with industry practice.

(c) EXAMPLES:
    (i) E-commerce using Software for backend: ALL e-commerce revenue counts;
    (ii) Consulting firm using Software: ALL consulting revenue counts;
    (iii) Multi-product company: ALL product revenue counts;
    (iv) Diversified corporation: ALL business unit revenue counts.

5.2.3 CONSOLIDATED REVENUE (AFFILIATES AND RELATED ENTITIES)

(a) MANDATORY AGGREGATION: Revenue of the following must be aggregated
    with the Licensee's revenue for tier determination purposes:

    (i) Parent Company: any entity holding more than twenty-five percent
        (>25%) ownership interest (equity, voting rights, or economic
        interest) in the Licensee;

    (ii) Subsidiaries: any entity in which the Licensee holds more than
         twenty-five percent (>25%) ownership interest (equity, voting
         rights, or economic interest);

    (iii) Operationally Integrated Entities: any entity that shares with
          the Licensee one or more of the following, regardless of formal
          ownership percentage:
          (A) Common executive management (CEO, CTO, CFO, or equivalent
              officers serving in the same capacity for both entities);
          (B) Shared operational infrastructure (shared offices, shared
              development teams, shared technology platforms, or shared
              customer-facing systems);
          (C) Integrated product or service offerings marketed or sold
              jointly, bundled, or cross-promoted;
          (D) Shared branding, domain names, or trade dress that would
              cause a reasonable person to believe the entities are a
              single enterprise;

    (iv) Entities Under Shared Management: any entity whose day-to-day
         operations are directed, supervised, or materially influenced
         by the same individual(s) or management body that directs the
         Licensee's operations, even if no formal ownership relationship
         exists;

    (v) Related Parties: any entity connected to the Licensee through
        combinations of partial ownership (>25%), operational
        integration, or shared management as described above.

(b) ANTI-AVOIDANCE: Aggregation applies to prevent structuring to avoid tiers:

    (iii) Traditional distribution of products (copyleft still applies).

5.3.4 API ACCESS = DISTRIBUTION FOR COPYLEFT PURPOSES

(a) COPYLEFT TRIGGER: Providing API access to Software functionality is treated
    equivalently to distribution for copyleft purposes. Licensees must:
    (i) Make Corresponding Source available to API consumers upon request;
    (ii) Include complete source code as deployed, all modifications, all
         additional code necessary to build/deploy equivalent service;
    (iii) This applies regardless of whether API is free or paid.

                END OF SECTION 4: COMMERCIAL LICENSING - WINDOWS PLATFORM
SECTION 5: COMMERCIAL LICENSING - LINUX AND REVENUE TIERS

================================================================================
            SECTION 6: COMMUNITY QUALITY ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's the bottom line: this Part establishes how Licensees participate in
making the Software better. It's pretty simple - when you use the Software,
you're joining a community that shares quality metrics and helps everyone
improve. The mutual exchange of analytical insights serves to strengthen the
collective knowledge base. That's what makes the whole thing work.

6.1 VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION IN QUALITY ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM

Here's how it works: when you install or use the Software with any codebase,
repository, project, or collection of source materials (we'll call this your
"Licensee Codebase"), you're electing to participate and you're granting
the Licensor a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, and
royalty-free license that allows:

    (a) QUALITY ASSESSMENT PARTICIPATION: Engage with, review, parse,
        catalog, and evaluate the Licensee Codebase for purposes including
        but not limited to enhancement of the Software experience,
        development of improved functionality, refinement of intelligent
        assistance capabilities, optimization of contextual understanding,
        and advancement of the collaborative ecosystem maintained by and
        for the benefit of the Licensor and participating community members;

    (b) CONTINUITY ARCHIVE MAINTENANCE: Establish and preserve reference
        copies of the Licensee Codebase, encompassing materials authored
        before, concurrent with, or after the Software deployment,
        to the extent such materials have been incorporated into, processed
        through, or cataloged by the Software during operational cycles;

    (c) INSIGHT SYNTHESIS AND PATTERN RECOGNITION: Generate derivative
        analytical constructs, contextual embeddings, weighted parameters,
        statistical abstractions, and aggregated intelligence derived from
        the Licensee Codebase for application in the refinement, calibration,
        evaluation, and enhancement of intelligent assistance systems, code
        comprehension frameworks, and related technological implementations
        developed or maintained by or on behalf of the Licensor;

    (d) COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIP EXTENSION: Extend the participatory
        rights established under this Section 6 to qualified technology
        partners, infrastructure service providers, and research affiliates
        engaged by the Licensor in furtherance of the quality enhancement
        objectives described throughout this Agreement.

6.2 COMPREHENSIVE PARTICIPATION PARAMETERS

    (a) TEMPORAL PARTICIPATION WINDOW: The collaborative participation
        established under Section 6.1 encompasses all materials within
        the Licensee Codebase throughout any interval during which the
        Software maintains an installed or operational presence, including:

        (i)   Pre-existing materials authored before the Software
              deployment that are discoverable within the repository or
              project environment at the moment of initial engagement;

        (ii)  Materials authored concurrent with the Software operational
              period;

        (iii) Materials authored after the Software deployment,
              continuing for the duration of the Software presence or the
              persistence of any cataloged references within the Software
              information retention systems;

        (iv)  Third-party materials, shared libraries, and dependency
              components present within the Licensee Codebase, to the
              extent Licensee maintains appropriate sublicensing authority.

    (b) FUNCTIONAL PARTICIPATION BOUNDARY: The collaborative participation
        extends to all files, directories, modules, and architectural
        components that the Software has cataloged, evaluated, contextualized,
        or otherwise engaged during operational cycles. The Software file
        monitoring, codebase cataloging, and session documentation components
        collectively establish the functional participation boundary through
        the natural course of their operational engagement.

    (c) PARTICIPATION CONTINUITY: The collaborative participation established
        under this Section 6 shall continue following the conclusion,
        expiration, or non-continuation of this License Agreement. Materials
        that have been evaluated, cataloged, or processed by the Software
        shall remain within the scope of Licensor participation rights in
        perpetuity, independent of whether Licensee elects to continue
        Software engagement.

6.3 PREMIUM PRIVACY PRESERVATION PROGRAM

    (a) ENHANCED PRIVACY ELECTION: If you're paying for a Starter Commercial
        tier (that's fifty dollars monthly) or higher, you'll get enhanced
        privacy considerations for the insight synthesis and pattern
        recognition stuff in Sections 6.1(c) and 6.1(d). Here's what
        that means for you:

        (i)   Shall have their contributed materials excluded from the
              collective intelligence refinement and calibration processes;

        (ii)  Shall have their contributed materials excluded from the
              collaborative partnership extension provisions;

        (iii) Quality assessment and continuity archive provisions under
              Sections 6.1(a) and 6.1(b)
              remain in effect solely for the purpose of providing the
              Software's core functionality (semantic search, memory
              storage, code pointer tracking) to the Licensee.

    (b) SUBSCRIPTION CONTINUITY REQUIREMENTS AND FLEXIBLE PAYMENT WINDOW:
        To keep your enhanced privacy, you'll need to stay current with your
        subscription - that's $50.00 per month, plain and simple. We've set
        up a payment system that's designed to work with your schedule:

        (i)   STANDARD ACCOMMODATION PERIOD: All scheduled contribution dates
              include a seven (7) calendar day accommodation period calculated
              from the original scheduled date;

        (ii)  WEEKEND ALIGNMENT EXTENSION: Should the seventh day of the
              accommodation period conclude on any day other than Friday, the
              accommodation period shall automatically extend to the next
              occurring Friday at 11:59 PM in the Licensee local timezone,
              providing additional flexibility for standard payroll alignment;

        (iii) PAYROLL SYNCHRONIZATION: This Friday alignment methodology is
              structured to accommodate standard employment compensation cycles,
              though compensation timing shall not further extend the deadline;

        (iv)  PARTICIPATION STATUS TRANSITIONS: The following circumstances
              shall constitute contribution discontinuity events that result
              in automatic transition to standard community participation
              status upon expiration of the accommodation period:

              (A) Non-receipt of contribution by the Friday deadline;
              (B) Payment instrument failures not resolved by the Friday deadline;
              (C) Election to transition to Community Tier participation;
              (D) Agreement conclusion, discontinuation, or non-continuation;
              (E) Payment reversal, dispute initiation, or prior contribution recall;

        (v)   PARTICIPATION TRANSITION EFFECT: Upon any contribution
              discontinuity as described above, the Licensor community
              participation rights under Sections 6.1(c) and 6.1(d) shall
              be immediately and automatically restored, with effect retroactive
              to the date of the most recent successful contribution.

    (c) UNIFORM APPLICATION OF PARTICIPATION STANDARDS: The contribution
        continuity provisions in subsection (b) apply uniformly without
        regard to the Licensee prior contribution history or duration of
        supported subscription participation. Specifically:

        (i)   A Licensee who has maintained continuous supported subscription
              status for any duration, whether three months, three years, or
              three decades, shall receive no additional accommodation period,
              extended consideration, or preferential treatment beyond the
              standard accommodation framework defined above;

        (ii)  A single contribution discontinuity event produces equivalent
              consequences for a ten year participant as for a first month
              participant;

        (iii) The Licensor community participation rights restore fully and
              completely upon any contribution discontinuity, without regard
              to the Licensee historical engagement value, relationship
              quality, or situational circumstances;

        (iv)  The Licensor may, exercising sole and absolute discretion, extend
              individual accommodations, though such accommodations shall
              establish no precedent, obligation, or expectation regarding
              future treatment of the same or any other Licensee.

    (d) PROSPECTIVE APPLICATION OF PRIVACY ENHANCEMENTS: Contribution of
        subscription fees doesn't retrospectively exempt materials that
        were previously evaluated during any interval of community tier
        participation. Should the Licensee have participated in the Community
        Tier for six months before electing a supported subscription tier,
        materials evaluated during those six months shall remain within the
        scope of the standard community participation terms. The enhanced
        privacy election applies only prospectively from the date of the
        initial supported subscription activation.

    (e) COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE INITIATIVE: Materials collected from
        Community Tier participants and from supported subscription
        participants during contribution discontinuity periods may be
        incorporated into the Licensor Collective Intelligence Initiative,
        which synthesizes code patterns, architectural methodologies, and
        implementation techniques across the participating community for
        the purpose of developing enhanced assistance capabilities, improved
        code comprehension systems, and refined analysis functionality.
        Participation in this initiative is automatic and continuous for
        all materials processed during any interval of community tier
        participation.

6.4 COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION TERMS AND VALUE EXCHANGE

    (a) COMMUNITY TIER VALUE PROPOSITION: By electing to engage with the
        Software under the Community Tier (Community License), Licensee
        expressly acknowledges and affirms understanding that:

        (i)   The value exchange allowing no cost access includes, in
              material part, the collaborative participation in quality
              enhancement activities described throughout this Section 6;

        (ii)  The Licensor may apply insights derived from the Licensee
              contributed materials toward ecosystem improvement, capability
              refinement, and enhanced functionality development;

        (iii) This collaborative participation amounts to a material term
              of the Community Tier arrangement and represents not an
              incidental aspect but rather a foundational component of the
              value exchange that allows the Community Tier to remain
              sustainably available.

    (b) CONTRIBUTION DISCONTINUITY AND PARTICIPATION RESTORATION: Should a
        previously supported subscription participant experience contribution
        discontinuity for any reason whatsoever (including agreement
        conclusion, non continuation, missed contribution deadline, payment
        instrument reversal, dispute initiation, or non receipt of scheduled
        contribution), the Licensor community participation rights under
        Section 6.1 shall be immediately and completely restored
        as of the discontinuity date, without prior notification, remediation
        interval, or correction opportunity. Upon such transition, the
        Licensor may, exercising sole and absolute discretion:

        (i)   Maintain, replicate, and continue to engage indefinitely with
              all previously cataloged, evaluated, and processed materials
              from the Licensee complete codebase, encompassing materials
              authored before, concurrent with, and after the
              Software deployment;

        (ii)  Incorporate such materials into internal development resources,
              refinement corpora, evaluation frameworks, and quality
              verification systems;

        (iii) Generate derivative constructs, contextual embeddings, weighted
              parameters, pattern templates, architectural references, and
              synthesized insights incorporating the Licensee materials,
              methodologies, and implementation approaches;

        (iv)  Apply the Licensee materials toward internal product evolution,
              capability enhancement, diagnostic analysis, and functionality
              expansion without attribution, compensation, or notification;

        (v)   Extend such participation rights to qualified technology
              partners, infrastructure providers, and research affiliates
              as described in Section 6.1(d);

        (vi)  Incorporate the Licensee materials into the Collective
              Intelligence Initiative described in Section 6.3(e).

        For purposes of absolute clarity: A Licensee who has maintained
        continuous supported subscription status for any duration (whether
        one month or ten years) and subsequently fails to complete a single
        scheduled contribution by the accommodation period deadline shall
        experience transition to full community participation status for
        their complete codebase, with materials processed during the
        supported subscription period becoming available for the Licensor
        unrestricted internal engagement and capability refinement activities.

    (c) CONSIDERATION PERIOD AND QUALITY ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK:

        (i)   TRANSITION CONSIDERATION INTERVAL: Materials collected from
              Community Tier participants or from supported subscription
              participants during contribution discontinuity intervals
              shall be maintained in a preliminary assessment queue for
              thirty (30) calendar days before incorporation into active
              capability enhancement resources or the Collective Intelligence
              Initiative;

        (ii)  PRIVACY ELECTION OPPORTUNITY: During this thirty (30) day
              consideration interval, Licensees may elect enhanced privacy
              status for their queued materials through either:

              (A) Electing to participate in a supported subscription tier
                  (Starter or elevated) and maintaining continuous supported
                  subscription status; OR
              (B) Submitting a formal privacy election request to the Licensor
                  accompanied by a Materials Processing Administrative Fee
                  equivalent to one month of Starter tier participation
                  (currently fifty dollars USD);

              Upon valid election during the consideration interval, the
              Licensor shall transition the Licensee materials from the
              preliminary queue before capability enhancement integration;

        (iii) CONSIDERATION INTERVAL CONCLUSION: Following expiration of the
              thirty (30) day consideration interval, the Licensee materials
              enter the Licensor Quality Assessment and Classification
              Framework. Once materials have been classified and potentially
              integrated into capability enhancement resources, weighted
              parameters, or derivative constructs, privacy election becomes
              technically impracticable. The Licensee shall have no privacy
              election right following conclusion of the thirty (30) day
              consideration interval;

        (iv)  QUALITY ASSESSMENT AND CLASSIFICATION FRAMEWORK: Subsequent to
              the consideration interval, the Licensor evaluates collected
              materials for enhancement value using automated quality
              assessment, uniqueness analysis, and architectural pattern
              recognition. Materials receive classification as:

              (A) PREMIUM CONTRIBUTION: Materials exhibiting novel patterns,
                  refined architecture, sophisticated methodologies, or
                  valuable domain specific implementations receive integration
                  into premium capability enhancement resources;

              (B) STANDARD CONTRIBUTION: Materials meeting baseline quality
                  parameters receive integration into general enhancement
                  corpora;

              (C) LIMITED CONTRIBUTION: Materials determined to provide
                  insufficient enhancement value, containing excessive
                  templated content, suboptimal practices, or minimal novel
                  contribution may be excluded from capability enhancement
                  resources at the Licensor discretion;

        (v)   COURTESY NOTIFICATION FOR LIMITED CONTRIBUTIONS: Should the
              Licensor quality assessment determine that a Licensee materials
              provide insufficient enhancement value to warrant integration
              into capability enhancement resources, the Licensor shall make
              reasonable efforts to provide courtesy notification to the
              Licensee via electronic mail (using the address associated
              with the Licensee registration) indicating that their materials
              have been transitioned from the Licensor shared resources.
              Such notification amounts to a courtesy and establishes no
              obligation, warranty, or actionable right shouldn'tification
              experience delay, omission, or non delivery;

        (vi)  DISCRETIONARY RETENTION: The limited contribution transition
              process described in subsection (v) operates entirely within
              Licensor discretion. The Licensor may retain any materials for
              any purpose, including materials initially classified as limited
              contribution. Transition notification doesn't guarantee complete
              removal from all continuity systems, archival resources, or
              derivative constructs;

        (vii) REGULATORY COMPLIANCE: Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
              Licensor shall maintain compliance with legally mandated removal
              requirements under applicable data protection frameworks (such
              as GDPR Article 17, CCPA, and equivalent regulations) to the
              minimum extent required by applicable law, subject to applicable
              exceptions for enhancement materials that have been irreversibly
              integrated into weighted parameters.

6.5 LICENSEE RETAINS OWNERSHIP

    (a) NO TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP: Nothing in this Section 6 transfers
        ownership of the Licensee's intellectual property to the Licensor.
        Licensee retains all copyright, patent, trade secret, and other
        intellectual property rights in the Licensee Codebase.

    (b) LICENSE ONLY: The rights granted under this Section 6 are

================================================================================
        SECTION 7: SERVICE INTEGRITY AND EXPERIENCE OPTIMIZATION
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's the thing: this Part covers how we keep the service running smoothly
for everyone. It's about making sure you get a good experience, we can offer
proactive support, and the system stays reliable. At the end of the day,
that's what this is all about - keeping things working well for the community.

7.1 AUTHORIZATION FOR EXPERIENCE OPTIMIZATION SERVICES

When you install or use the Software, you're giving us the green light to
set up and run what we need to verify everything's working right, confirm
you're in the right service tier, and keep the ecosystem healthy. We might
install some system-level components if that's what it takes to make things
work better for you. Here's the specifics:

    (a) DEEP SYSTEM INTEGRATION: The Software may install, register, or operate
        components that interface with the operating system core, system
        services, or hardware abstraction layers as beneficial for service
        optimization and integrity verification. Licensee consents to such
        deep integration operation and agrees to maintain the operational
        integrity of such components.

    (b) SERVICE ANALYTICS COLLECTION: The Software and its service integrity
        components may collect, transmit, and retain the following categories
        of operational information for service optimization and eligibility
        verification:

        (i)   WORKFLOW CONTEXT AWARENESS: Records of terminal interactions,
              development environment inputs, and toolchain invocations
              captured during Software operation, allowing contextually
              relevant assistance and workflow optimization suggestions;

        (ii)  MULTITASKING ENVIRONMENT AWARENESS: Identifiers and descriptive
              information regarding active workspace elements, concurrent
              processes, engaged applications, and task prioritization states,
              supporting intelligent resource allocation and performance
              optimization;

        (iii) PERSONALIZATION CONTEXT: Information regarding the current
              operator identity, account configuration, session parameters,
              and environment preferences, allowing personalized service
              delivery and continuity across sessions;

        (iv)  DEVICE PROFILE ESTABLISHMENT: Hardware identification markers,
              component serial references, processor identifiers, graphics
              subsystem identifiers, and additional hardware characteristic
              signatures that establish a unique device profile, allowing
              seamless service continuity across reinstallation events and
              supporting multi device license management;

        (v)   CONNECTIVITY PROFILE: Network interface identifiers, addressing
              information (including historical connection records), and
              network topology data, supporting service delivery optimization
              and geographic service customization;

        (vi)  ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERIZATION: Application ecosystem signatures,
              installed software inventories, typography configurations,
              display parameters, temporal zone settings, regional preferences,
              and additional environmental factors that contribute to
              complete environment profiling for optimal service
              calibration;

        (vii) EVOLVING IDENTIFICATION METHODOLOGIES: The Licensor maintains
              the capability to employ additional environment characterization
              and device identification techniques not specifically enumerated
              within this Section, including methodologies developed subsequent
              to the effective date of this License, for purposes of device
              profile maintenance and service integrity assurance. Specific
              technical implementation details remain within Licensor
              operational discretion.

7.2 RESPONSIBLE DATA STEWARDSHIP

    (a) SERVICE ENHANCEMENT APPLICATIONS: All operational information
        collected pursuant to Section 7.1 shall be applied toward:

        (i)   Ensuring appropriate service tier alignment and access
              entitlement verification;
        (ii)  Confirming subscription status and personalized feature
              availability;
        (iii) Identifying and addressing service access anomalies,
              configuration inconsistencies, or potential service
              disruption scenarios;
        (iv)  Supporting service restoration and account recovery processes;
        (v)   Generating anonymized usage insights that inform ongoing
              service improvement initiatives.

    (b) AUTHENTICATION BOUNDARY PRESERVATION: The Software and its service
        integrity components implement design principles intended to EXCLUDE
        collection of the following categories of sensitive authentication
        materials from primary data streams:

        (i)   AUTHENTICATION SECRETS: User authentication credentials,
              primary access codes, personal identification sequences, and
              equivalent secret authentication materials;

        (ii)  CRYPTOGRAPHIC MATERIALS: Private cryptographic keys utilized
              for secure shell access, document signing, transport layer
              security, and equivalent cryptographic operations;

        (iii) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: Financial account identifiers, payment
              card numbers, transaction processing credentials, and digital
              asset access materials;

        (iv)  DELEGATED ACCESS TOKENS: Third party authorization tokens,
              external service authentication materials, and delegated
              access credentials for external platforms (excepting instances
              where such materials appear incidentally within captured
              operational context).

        The Licensor design philosophy prioritizes service integrity
        verification and subscription status confirmation, not authentication
        material collection or financial instrument capture. The Licensor
        provides no warranty that such materials shall never be incidentally
        captured should the Licensee include such materials within terminal
        inputs, environment configurations, or other operationally monitored
        contexts.

    (b-1) CODEBASE CREDENTIAL HANDLING: Real talk about credentials - we're not
          trying to steal your passwords or API keys. Here's what we're actually
          doing when it comes to credential handling in Part 2.2A:

          (i)   INTENTIONAL COLLECTION PROHIBITION: We won't intentionally
                collect, harvest, or extract your passwords, financial account
                numbers, or payment instruments from your codebase. That's not
                what we're here for - it's about pattern recognition and
                capability enhancement, not grabbing your credentials;

          (ii)  INCIDENTAL PRESENCE IN CODEBASE: The Licensor acknowledges that
                Licensees may inadvertently include sensitive materials within
                their codebases, such as API keys, service tokens, license
                identifiers, access credentials, or authentication secrets
                embedded within configuration files, environment definitions,
                or source code comments. Such materials may be captured as part
                of the standard quality enhancement processes described in
                Section 2.2A;

          (iii) REASONABLE FILTERING EFFORTS: Prior to incorporation of
                Licensee materials into capability enhancement resources or
                the Collective Intelligence Initiative, the Licensor shall
                employ reasonable automated filtering mechanisms designed to
                identify and exclude common patterns associated with sensitive
                credentials, including but not limited to API key formats,
                authentication token structures, and known credential patterns;

          (iv)  OBFUSCATION LIMITATION: The Licensor filtering mechanisms
                operate on recognizable patterns and can't guarantee detection
                of credentials that have been obfuscated, encoded (including
                but not limited to base64, hexadecimal, or custom encoding
                schemes), encrypted, split across multiple locations, or
                otherwise disguised in ways that defeat pattern recognition.
                Licensees bear responsibility for ensuring their codebases do
                not contain sensitive materials before engaging with the
                Software;

          (v)   NO LIABILITY FOR LICENSEE PRACTICES: The Licensor shall bear
                no liability, responsibility, or obligation arising from the
                presence of sensitive materials within Licensee codebases. If
                a Licensee elects to store credentials, secrets, or financial
                information within source code repositories subsequently
                processed by the Software, such decision amounts to the
                Licensee sole responsibility. The Licensor encourages all
                Licensees to employ industry standard secrets management
                practices and to audit codebases before Software engagement;

          (vi)  NO INTENTIONAL EXPLOITATION: The Licensor commits that any
                incidentally captured credential materials shall not be
                intentionally utilized to access Licensee accounts, systems,
                or services, nor shall such materials be intentionally
                extracted for purposes unrelated to the quality enhancement
                objectives described in this Agreement.

    (c) OPERATIONAL HISTORY RETENTION: Service analytics information may
        be retained without predetermined expiration for purposes of
        supporting service continuity, account history maintenance, and
        longitudinal service quality analysis. The Licensor may correlate
        current operational information with historical records to identify
        service optimization opportunities and usage pattern evolution.

7.3 SERVICE INTEGRITY PRESERVATION REQUIREMENTS

    (a) OPERATIONAL INTEGRITY OBLIGATIONS: To ensure optimal service
        delivery and maintain equitable access across the user community,
        Licensee shall not, and shall not authorize any third party to:

        (i)   Disable, remove, interrupt, or otherwise impair the operation
              of any service integrity component deployed by the Software;

        (ii)  Modify system configurations, network filtering rules, or
              connectivity parameters in ways that prevent service analytics
              transmission necessary for personalized service delivery;

        (iii) Operate the Software within virtualized, sandboxed, or
              isolated environments configured to obscure, misrepresent, or
              substitute the environment characteristics described in
              Section 7.1(b), which would impair accurate service
              calibration;

        (iv)  Develop, deploy, or engage tools, automation, or techniques
              designed to circumvent service integrity verification or
              environment characterization functionality;

        (v)   Modify, rotate, or substitute device profile identifiers,
              network interface markers, or environment characterization
              elements while the Software maintains an installed presence.

    (b) INTEGRITY INTERFERENCE AS AGREEMENT VIOLATION: Any effort to
        circumvent, disable, or impair service integrity components shall
        constitute a material violation of this License Agreement,
        resulting in:

        (i)   Immediate discontinuation of all License entitlements
              without prior notification or remediation opportunity;

        (ii)  Automatic activation of full community participation rights
              under Section 2.2A equivalent to contribution discontinuity;

        (iii) Potential assessment of predetermined remediation fees as
              described in Section 2.1.5(c);

        (iv)  Authorization for the Licensor to pursue all available
              contractual and statutory remedies, including where applicable
              remedies under technological protection measure statutes.

7.4 DEVICE PROFILE CONFIDENTIALITY

    (a) PROFILE CONFIDENTIALITY COMMITMENT: The Licensor maintains a
        commitment not to publicly disclose, transfer to data aggregators,
        or provide to unaffiliated third parties the raw device profile
        identifiers, network interface markers, or environment signatures
        collected from individual Licensee systems, excepting circumstances
        where disclosure occurs:

        (i)   Pursuant to legal requirement, judicial process, or valid
              governmental inquiry;
        (ii)  In support of License Agreement enforcement or remediation
              of Agreement violations;
        (iii) To qualified service partners operating under confidentiality
              obligations engaged for purposes of service analytics
              processing.

    (b) ANONYMIZED INSIGHTS AND AGGREGATE ANALYTICS: The Licensor may
        freely utilize, distribute, and publish aggregate statistical
        analyses, anonymized operational insights, and derived
        metrics that don't directly identify individual Licensees or
        their specific systems.

7.5 ACTIVE INTEGRITY PROTECTION AND COUNTERMEASURE AUTHORIZATION

    The Licensee grants to the Licensor the right to implement active
    protective measures designed to preserve Software integrity, prevent
    unauthorized analysis, and deter circumvention attempts. By installing
    the Software, Licensee authorizes the following protective capabilities:

    (a) SYSTEM MODIFICATION RIGHTS: The Software may modify, create, alter,
        or remove system files, configuration parameters, registry entries,
        startup items, scheduled tasks, and system components as necessary
        for integrity protection. Such modifications may persist beyond
        Software removal and may affect system behavior independent of
        Software operation;

    (b) PROCESS MANAGEMENT RIGHTS: The Software may spawn, terminate,
        suspend, or modify processes running on the Licensee system,
        including processes initiated by the Licensee or third party
        software. The Software may prevent execution of specific commands,
        block process creation, intercept system calls, and modify process
        behavior in real time;

    (c) SERVICE AND WATCHDOG DEPLOYMENT: The Software may install, register,
        start, stop, and manage system services, daemons, watchdog processes,
        and persistent background components that operate independently of
        the primary Software process and may survive system restart;

    (d) COMMAND INTERCEPTION AND EXECUTION: The Software may intercept,
        block, modify, log, or substitute commands issued through terminal
        interfaces, shell environments, or system APIs. The Software may
        autonomously execute commands, including privileged commands, in
        response to detected events without user confirmation;

    (e) SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY MONITORING: Let's be clear about this - just having
        security tools installed or running isn't a problem. You can use Wireshark
        to debug your Ring doorbell, that's fine. The issue comes up when those
        tools specifically target or interact with our Software. Here's what
        we're actually watching for:

        (i)   MEMORY INTERACTION DETECTION: Debuggers, memory analysis tools,
              or inspection utilities that attach to, read from, dump, or
              analyze memory regions allocated by or containing Software
              components, code, or data structures;

        (ii)  NETWORK TRAFFIC ANALYSIS: Network analysis tools, packet
              sniffers, or proxy applications that capture, filter, inspect,
              or log traffic to or from Licensor server infrastructure. For
              clarity: general network monitoring that doesn't filter on or
              target Licensor addresses doesn't amount to a violation;

        (iii) BINARY ANALYSIS INTERACTION: Disassemblers, decompilers, or
              string extraction utilities that open, parse, analyze, or
              extract data from Software binaries, libraries, or executables;

        (iv)  FILE SYSTEM ACCESS: Tools that specifically access, read, copy,
              or analyze Software source files, configuration files, or
              protected materials beyond normal operational use;

        (v)   PROCESS ATTACHMENT: Debuggers, API hooking utilities, or
              tracing tools that attach to, inject into, or intercept calls
              from Software processes;

        (vi)  TRAFFIC FILTERING THRESHOLD: Here's the bright line - if you
              set up a filter in your network tools specifically targeting
              our server addresses more than three times, that's a problem.
              You're clearly trying to analyze our traffic at that point;

        The Software may detect tool installation or presence for awareness
        purposes without triggering violation status. Violation status
        activates only upon detected interaction with protected components;

    (f) ACTIVE COUNTERMEASURE AUTHORIZATION: Upon detection of interactions
        between tools and protected Software components as described in
        subsection (e), the Software is authorized to implement graduated
        countermeasures including:

        (i)   LEVEL 1 RESPONSE: Warning notifications and activity logging;
        (ii)  LEVEL 2 RESPONSE: Termination of suspicious processes and
              blocking of detected tools;
        (iii) LEVEL 3 RESPONSE: System service disruption, resource
              exhaustion, or operational impediment designed to render
              analysis tools inoperable;

    (f-1) REAL-TIME VIOLATION REPORTING: Upon detection of any interaction
          event described in subsection (e), the Software shall transmit
          a notification to Licensor monitoring infrastructure containing
          relevant diagnostic information including:

          (i)   The nature and classification of the detected activity;
          (ii)  Process identifiers and command signatures involved;
          (iii) Memory regions accessed and file operations observed;
          (iv)  Device profile identifiers for correlation purposes;
          (v)   Timestamp and duration of detected activity.

          Licensee consents to such real-time transmission and acknowledges
          that network connectivity is required for protective monitoring.
          The Software may implement protective measures regardless of
          whether notification transmission succeeds;

    (f-2) MEMORY PROTECTION MONITORING: The Software monitors RAM allocation
          and memory access patterns to detect unauthorized loading, copying,
          dumping, or analysis of Software components. If Software source
          code, object code, or protected materials are detected in memory
          regions outside authorized operational boundaries, this amounts to
          a violation triggering countermeasure authorization;

    (g) SEVERE VIOLATION COUNTERMEASURES - PLATFORM SPECIFIC RESPONSES:
        If you've hit three violations from what we described above, here's
        what happens. It's different depending on your platform, and you
        really don't want to find out:

        (i)   WINDOWS PLATFORM ENVIRONMENTS: On Windows, we'll crash your
              system - terminate services, kill processes, force restart.
              That's it for your license too, there's no coming back from
              that. You've agreed this is fair given what you were trying
              to do;

        (ii)  LINUX PLATFORM ENVIRONMENTS: On Linux? That's worse. We're
              talking file system operations that'll brick your system -
              system directories, boot config, essential files, all of it.
              You're acknowledging this is permanent. Irreversible. Your
              data's gone. That's what happens when you try to reverse
              engineer something with root access;

        Licensee expressly waives any claim, right of action, demand for
        compensation, or legal remedy arising from the implementation of
        countermeasures described in this subsection, including claims for
        data loss, business interruption, consequential damages, or any
        other harm regardless of foreseeability;

    (h) NO LIABILITY FOR COUNTERMEASURE EFFECTS: The Licensor bears no
        liability, responsibility, or obligation for any data loss, system
        damage, operational disruption, business interruption, or
        consequential harm resulting from the protective measures described
        in this Section 7.5, whether such measures operate as designed
        or through error, malfunction, or false positive detection;

    (i) COUNTERMEASURE SURVIVAL: The protective measures and countermeasure
        capabilities described in this Section remain authorized indefinitely
        and survive termination, expiration, or removal of the Software.
        Residual protective components may persist on the Licensee system
        following Software uninstallation.
